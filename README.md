There is growing interest in developing a high-performance self-supervised denoising algorithm for real-time chemical hyperspectral imaging. With a good understanding of the working function of the zero-shot Noise2Noise-based denoising algorithm, we developed a self-supervised Signal2Signal (S2S) algorithm for real-time denoising with a single chemical hyperspectral image. Owing to the accurate distinction and capture of the weak signal from the random fluctuating noise, S2S displays excellent denoising performance, even for the hyperspectral image with a spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 1.12. Under this condition, both the image clarity and the spatial resolution could be significantly improved and present an almost identical pattern with a spectral SNR of 7.87. The feasibility of real-time denoising during imaging was well demonstrated, and S2S was applied to monitor the photoinduced exfoliation of transition metal dichalcogenide, which is hard to accomplish by confocal Raman spectroscopy. In general, the real-time denoising capability of S2S offers an easy way toward in situ/in vivo/operando research with much improved spatial and temporal resolution. S2S is open-source at https://github.com/3331822w/Signal2signal and will be accessible online at https://ramancloud.xmu.edu.cn/tutorial.
